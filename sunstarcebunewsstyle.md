1. Set in capitals if the acronym is not a recognizable word, such as MCWD (Metro Cebu Water District), DPWH (Department of Public Works and Highways) or DSWD (Department of Social Welfare and Development).**

2. Acronyms made up of only three letters must be capitalized as well to allow easy reading, such as VAT.**

3. However, acronyms with more than three letters and which can be read as a word must be set in caps and lower case, such as Clear (Center for Labor Advocacy, Education and Research).**

    - **Advice** (noun), **advise** (verb)
    - **Aids** Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

        Use person with Aids, instead of Aids victim. (*Note*: Additional section being drafted on Aids-sensitive terms.)

    - **Alleged**, **allegedly**

        Indicates that the paper is reporting a charge or accusation made by someone else. As such, the source of an allegation must be specific. In a criminal case, the source must be official.

        Police *alleged* that John Doe killed his mother.

        **NOT**: Police said John Doe allegedly killed his mother.

    - **Allude**, **refer**

        To *allude* to something is to *refer* to it without mentioning it by name. To refer to something is to mention it by name.

    - **all ready** (prepared), **already** (previously)
    - **all right** (never alright).

        Jenny doesn't live here *anymore*, as there isn't *any more* space.

    - **any one** (any single person or thing), **anyone** (any person at all)

### Apostrophes

Forms the possessives of nouns, indicates omissions or contractions.

1. **Omissions** Use to indicate omissions in quoted speech or indicate omitted numbers: o'er the hills; he was born in the '40s.

2. **Possessives**

    - Use 's to form the plural of nouns not ending in s. Examples: Miss David's, children's
    - Use 's to form the plural of proper nouns or names ending in a sounded s, such as Marites's, the chorus's, Mars's
    - Use the apostrophe alone to form the plural of nouns ending in a silent s. Examples: Arkansas' crop, the corps' project
    - Use the apostrophe for plural possessives such as Ramoses', the princesses'
    - Don't use the apostrophe in possessive pronouns such as its, his, hers, theirs.
    - When referring to more than one person, use the apostrophe once to show common possession, but separately for individual possession.

        Examples: John and Mary's car, but John's and Mary's rooms.

    - An apostrophe is needed for some idiomatic phrases even when there is no actual ownership: a day's wages, for old times' sake, two hours' trip. But: three days overdue, six months pregnant.

3. **Plurals**

    The apostrophe is used to form the plural only for single letters, but not for others.

    - **So**: straight A's, dot your t's, but 1960s, 80s. Exceptions: do's and don'ts. 

        appraise (to set a monetary value on), apprise (to inform)

### Capitalization

1. Capitalize proper nouns and official titles which precede names in text.

    In headlines, capitalize only the first letter of the first word, aside from the proper nouns.

2. Use lowercase for the names of legislative committees: the Senate blue ribbon *committee*, the House *committee* on justice and human rights.

3. Lower case city, province and government when used as generic terms, but capitalize them when referring to a specific unit.

    Cebu *city* residents cannot vote for officials of the *Province*, but are of course included in elections for *National Government* positions.

    The *government* cannot prohibit the entry of persons with HIV.

4. Capitalize proper nouns referring to the divinity and religious groups or sects, except in generic references.

    **So**: God, Allah, Yahweh, Muslims, Roman Catholics  
    **But**: a Greek god, pagan goddesses

5. Use lower case when referring to everyday rites or ceremonies such as the mass, last rites, baptism.

    But capitalize religious holidays such as Christmas, Lent, Holy Week, Easter, Ramadan.

6. The word following a colon is capitalized in headlines. In text, the word following a colon is capitalized only if it belongs to a complete sentence.

    **Right**: She had many skills: dancing, singing, painting.  
    **Right**: Her worry: She had far too many things to do.

### Captions or cutlines

1. Whenever possible, identify all persons in a photo.

2. Captions assume that the action took place yesterday and are set in the present tense unless some other specific time in the past is mentioned.

3. Captions identifying more than two persons use the form from left, not from left to right.

4. When a photo is old, generally a year or more, specify when it was taken, especially if the subject's appearance is known to have changed since the photo was taken.

5. Avoid the term looks on. There's no need to state the obvious. Besides, people usually watch or listen; they don't just look on.

### Compound words

1. When the compound noun precedes a noun, use a hyphen between an adjective and a noun, between an adjective and an adverb, between a noun and an adjective or participle and between a verb and a preposition.

    Examples: a first-rate play, large-scale project, far-reaching legislation, record-breaking feat

2. If a modifier preceding a noun contains several words, all must be hyphenated except when the noun phrase is capitalized.

    too-good-to-be-true bonus  
    arge-than-life cartoon character

    You will notice, however, that these modifiers are awkward and can thus be rephrased.

    Better - She thought the bonus was too good to be true.

3. Do not hyphenate a compound in which the first element is an adverb ending in ly: a completely inept performance, her eagerly awaited visit.

### Commas

1. Use a comma to separate words and simple phrases in a series, but not before the conjunction.

    red, white, green and blue  
    she danced, sang and talked the night away.

2. You need a comma to set off words in apposition u the words that are identifiers. If an apposition is eliminated, the sentence will still be grammatically correct.

    The painter, Juan Gomez, drew critical acclaim.

3. Use a comma to introduce a one-sentence direct quote, but not before indirect quotes.

    She said, "I hope you'll enjoy your meal."  
    She said she was sorry to be late.

4. Use a comma to end a quote that normally would end in a period. You don't need a comma for quotes that end in an exalamation point, question mark or ellipsis.

    "That's a stupid proposal," he said.  
    "I think you're right," she added.

5. Use a comma to separate two independent clauses that are joined by a conjunction.

    She bought the ingredients, and he thanked her for staying within their budget.

6. Use a comma to set off figures in apposition: The score, 19 - 6, astonished viewers of the Velasco-Bujilov match.
7. Use a comma to indicate the omission of a word or words: She was a winner from the start; he, a loser.
8. You need a comma for numbers higher than 999, but not in addresses, phone numbers or serial numbers.
9. Use a comma after the day and year in precise dates, but not when only the month and day or the month and year are used.

    **So**: Nov. 15, 1972, but in November 1972.

10. Use a comma before designations of academic or professional degrees and religious orders, but not before Jr., Sr., Ltd., Inc. and Roman numerals after names.

11. You generally won't need a comma before or after too.
12. Commas should not be used around restrictive clauses and phrases. A clause is restrictive if its omission would alter the meaning of the sentence.

    **Right** - Editors who mangle stories need to be reprimanded.  
    **Wrong** - Businessmen, who fail to pay taxes, should be jailed.

### Colons

1. Use a colon to introduce lists, tabulations, texts.
  
    She recommended four measures:...

2. Use a colon whenever a direct quotation contains two or more sentences, and whenever a quotation is preceded by a full sentence. Use a comma before a single-sentence quotation.

    The mayor said, "We will close the erring shops tomorrow."  
    The mayor put it this way: "We will close the erring shops tomorrow."

3. A verb before a colon is unnecessary.

    **Right** - The presentations: ...  
    **Wrong** - The presentations were: ...

### That

Use the conjunction that to introduce a dependent clause if the sentences sounds or looks awkward without it. In general, use that.

1. When A time element intervenes between the verb and the dependent clause.

    **Example**: The senator said Monday *that* the president had signed the bill.

2. Before subordinate clauses beginning with conjunctions such as after, although, because, before, in addition to, until and while.

    **Example**: He said *that* after he learned of the president’s plan, he decided to resign.

Use these only with wars and to establish sequence for people. Use Arabic numerals for all other cases.

**Examples:**

- World War II
- John Paul II

### Religious references
