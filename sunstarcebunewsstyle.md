2) Possessives

a) Use 's to form the plural of nouns not ending in s. Examples: Miss David's, children's

While is a noun. Awhile is an adverb for a short time. It is redundant to write for awhile.

**commas**

1) Use a comma to separate words and simple phrases in a series, but not before the conjunction.

red, white, green and blue

So - Nov. 15, 1972, but in November 1972.

10) use a comma before designations of academic or professional degrees and religious orders, but not before Jr., Sr., Ltd., Inc. and Roman numerals after names.

11) You generally won't need a comma before or after too.

12) Commas should not be used around restrictive clauses and phrases. A clause is restrictive if its omission would alter the meaning of the sentence.

2) If a modifier preceding a noun contains several words, all must be hyphenated except when the noun phrase is capitalized.

You will notice, however, that these modifiers are awkward and can thus be rephrased.

3) Do not hyphenate a compound in which the first element is an adverb ending in ly: a completely inept performance, her eagerly awaited visit.
